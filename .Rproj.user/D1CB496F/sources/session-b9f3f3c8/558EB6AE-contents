Hi all, I am David, I am currently doing a post-doc, researching the relationship between photosynthesis and sun-induced fluorescence. I am passionate about writing and I am deeply worried about the climate crisis and the deep inequalities present today. I am a supporter of climate equity and I recognize that the only way to move forward to end the climate and exploitation crisis is to build a internationalist movement with clear political goals. This blog is my attempt to put my views out there, to start a conservation about the politics of climate injustice. Besides science, I am very much intrigued by political economy, history and philosophy and I try to expand my intellectual horizon beyond just academia. The view expressed in the this blog are my own and do not represent the view of the universities or research institutes that I am affiliated with.
