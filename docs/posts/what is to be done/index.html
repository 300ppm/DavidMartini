<p>Climate change represents one of the major threats to human well being and personifies the excesses and inequalities of an economic system that demands ever expansion and growth year by year. The topic of climate change is vast; there is probably not a single discipline that is not touched or that cannot contribute to the field of climate change. To convincingly tackle the problem of climate change it is necessary to employ a multi-disciplinary approach and learn from fields such as climate science, political economy and history among many others. By definition is then impossible to be an expert on climate change and all its ramifications. Here I present a contribution, from the perspective of an ecologist and therefore a non-expert in many of the fields that define the climate change space. I describe the struggle we face and argue that the solution must be political in nature. Politics that goes beyond only protest in squares or international agreements, but also as a process of analysis and critique of the mechanism that brought us here. I specifically talk about the role of science, the historical context that has led us to the vast inequalities (in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, wages, ecological footprint) present today, the politics of the proposed solutions and I finally sketch the four futures we might encounter.</p>

<p>The causes of climate change are relatively straight forward to analyze nowadays, while the solutions are trickier. The question presents itself. Why did we not start to act on climate change fast enough? One thing is certain: if the only thing we needed was scientific consensus, we would have fixed climate change decades ago. What is actually needed is a massive re-organization of production, consumption and allocation of resources, which requires collective action, whose decisions are inherently political.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-climate-of-changing-politics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-climate-of-changing-politics">A climate of changing politics</h2>
<p>The concept of the political varies among the different schools of political philosophy. Broadly within the liberal tradition politics can be defined as the battle of ideas, where conflict is resolved through argumentation and appeals to universal ideals. For Karl Marx politics is the class struggle, for Carl Schmitt is the friend-enemy distinction. At a fundamental level politics is a power struggle among people.</p>
<p>I like to imagine politics as the process of moving a very heavy object from A to B, where you have a set of people pushing towards B and another set of people pushing from the other side in the opposite direction, resisting, slowing down or reversing the movement. So to move to B it is not only needed to apply a force in B direction to overcome inertia, but the force needs to be larger than the opposite force to result in the desired movement. In politics you can either have a few strong forces, or many smaller forces, but the many in order to be powerful need to push in the same direction, conscious of their collective power. If we want to take this analogy one step further, in the context of climate change the mass of the object that we are trying to move is increasing every year at about 3% and the floor is starting to crack under its massive weight.</p>
<p>In the context of climate change, politics is then a force towards a movement that must occur at all levels of society. In the squares, at town halls, at the workplace, but crucially also within and towards institutions.</p>
<p>Inside institutions, politics is as a process of criticism and reshaping of the power structures that have led us to a world characterized by vast inequality and climate crisis. Countless examples of institutions that can be targeted for climate action might be found, but in this text I’ll mostly focus on two; the first one is perhaps the largest structure of rules and norms that shape human behavior, which is the economic system. Capitalism is the overwhelmingly dominant economic order nowadays; it is absolutely pervasive in every aspect of life and shapes other institutions such as the media and advertisement. The second one is the institution of education and research. Universities and research institutes faced with the climate crisis seem to be content with just existing and maintaining their own power structures instead than being a vehicle for social progress.</p>
<p>Science has been absolutely crucial for better understanding and raising awareness to climate change. Without scientific research we wouldn’t be having this conversation. But science is not done in a vacuum; it is a social process that lives within a culture and has therefore to be continuously constructively critiqued. Let’s start then with the role of science in relation to climate change.</p>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The scientist often (consciously or unconsciously) sees itself as a member of the <em>intelligentsia</em>, an intellectual class detached from society, that has the duty and burden of producing objective knowledge. The general public admires and respects the scientist exactly because of the its perceived objectiveness, at least relative to other methods of inquiry. But what is objectivity? And can the scientist be objective? Scientific objectivity can be interpreted as willingness to stick to the facts, as a commitment to value-freedom or as a removal of personal biases from scientific reasoning<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>, and is the subject of many debates in the field of philosophy of science. What is certain is that a scientist can try its best to be objective in the process, in order to maximize transparency and replicability.

Inevitably this has an effect on the research, not on the methods or the results, but cultural biases find their way in our introductions, where we justify studying a particular ecosystem through the lens of ecosystem services, and in our conclusions, where we explain how a particular strategy might be used for <em>adaptation</em> to climate change. Of course there is no need to explain why it is necessary to justify studying a particular ecosystem on the basis of the monetizable service that it can do for us, or who should do the adapting.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn27"><p><sup>27</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="climate_leviathan">Wainwright and Mann (<a href="#ref-climate_leviathan" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;71</p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Climate change is a problem caused by a specific economic system, that affects our natural world and society at large and that must be resolved by collective action. The science of climate change involves a beautiful mix of diverse disciplines such as physics, climatology, atmospheric chemistry, biology, political economy, international relations, philosophy and many more. It is an issue that must be studied across the natural science-social science divide, an issue caused by, and affecting humans. And it is indeed the human factor that complicates our analysis, as the influence of conscious human activity in social relations establishes deep complexities for social analysis<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>. For example, for “the discipline of economics, neither its object of study (“the economy”) nor its core concepts ( “discounting,” for example) can be separated from the history of conquest and empire that facilitated the emergence of global capitalism”<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>. We live within a culture and yet we must criticize the culture that allowed the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere to rise so quickly. And science is certainly crucial in this endeavor, but science cannot win a battle which is in fact political.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>So we shouldn’t overestimate science, nor we should set our expectations too low. And from this point of view I am going to present two good faith criticisms of the most authoritative documents of climate science, the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC reports are divided in 3 groups; working group I (WGI) assesses “The Physical Science Basis”, working group II (WGII) focuses on “Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” and working group III (WGIII) assesses “Mitigation of climate change”. WGI presents a natural sciences view of climate change, based on physical processes and modelling. WGII has a much more of a human component, as it assesses and predicts how humans and ecosystems might be affected and how they might adapt to climate change. WGIII focuses on mitigation, whose future is essentially a question of political economy<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn31"><p><sup>31</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="climate_leviathan">Wainwright and Mann (<a href="#ref-climate_leviathan" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;85</p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The concept of adaptation, which is the focus of one of the chapters of the WGII, is particularly problematic as in the reports it is never stated who should do the adapting, and on whose terms we should adapt. Adaptation is defined as adjustment of our current system<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>. Examples of adaptations mentioned include levees, irrigation, enhancing food availability, restoring natural forest, cooperation with Indigenous Peoples, planned relocation, public works programs, improving access to potable water<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>. Adaptation options are listed in the typical dry and detached IPCC style. At first glance it seems a very thorough assessment, but it is essential to keep in mind that “when the world is offered a limited set of options, it is worth paying close attention to the fine print”<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>. No political adaptation seems required. Reading the IPCC, it almost seems that if only we built a few levees here and there and planned better relocations we could keep living large, just in a hotter world. To be fair, they mention the need of addressing social-inequities for effective adaptation by stating “inequity and poverty also constrain adaptation”<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>. But factors such as inequality and poverty are never integrated in a systemic view. Poverty is not treated as the result of an economic system that produces inequality by design, but just as an additional factor that it is going to influence negatively adaptation. Poverty exists, the world is getting hotter and people (in the abstract) need to adapt. Reading the summary for policy makers of WGII sometimes feels like an exercise in nihilist composure in the face of human suffering. The lack of any systemic view and the absence of a clear explanation of who will be forced to adapt and how much misery is going to involve, makes it so that it wouldn’t be too hard to believe that something like this made up quote was present in the text:</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn32"><p><sup>32</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="ipccwg2_spm">H.-O.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The WGII report paints a picture of a world in which systemic risks to the political and economic structure are negligible. Calculating climate change induced risk to human welfare and “the economy” requires estimates of future atmospheric carbon concentrations and a theory of how societies might adapt to complex changes<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The risk assessment is displayed to policy makers with an ingenious device that was invented by the IPCC in its third assessment<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>; a bar graph that shows for each degree of warming the risks (represented with “burning embers” colors) for various categories. Among the different categories there is “Unique and threatened systems”, which quantifies the risk for unique ecosystems as for example coral reefs, “Extreme weather events” and “Global aggregate impacts”. The last one is particularly puzzling because it is defined as “impacts to socio-ecological systems that can be aggregated globally into a single metric<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>, such as monetary damages, lives affected, species lost or ecosystem degradation at a global scale”. The unspoken assumption here is that dollars lost and lives lost are somehow interchangeable, two timeless and natural components of our system. But the loss of a person or of an entire species is an irreversible event, a catastrophe that has no place to be put next to monetary damage.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn38"><p><sup>38</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="ipccwg2">H.-O.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>At the current level of warming the risk of global aggregate impacts is undetectable. At 1.8 degrees of warming the risk for unique and threatened systems becomes very high, the risk for extreme weather event is high, and yet the risk for global aggregate impacts is only moderate<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>. So 1.8 degrees would cause significant stress to our Earth system, likely wiping out some ecosystems, and causing frequent extreme weather events.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The effect of climate change on the economy is represented in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) lost in comparison to a world without climate change.

Now that we know the price of inaction we can rationally calculate how much to spend! After all, if until now we didn’t do much to solve climate change surely it is because there was not a price on it, otherwise the market would have fixed it.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>A market failure is a situation in which markets do not mediate resources allocation efficiently or don’t exist at all. This is usually attributed to information asymmetry or the impossibility to privatize a public good.

Here are two examples of market failure as shown in the sixth assessment report of WGII of the IPCC:</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn43"><p><sup>43</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="ipccwg2">H.-O.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>“In the Congo Basin, farmers are adapting to increasingly variable rainfall by expanding their cropping activities into forested areas, releasing carbon into the atmosphere through forest clearance activities and threatening biodiversity”<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn44"><p><sup>44</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="ipccwg2">H.-O.

<p>This seems to suggest that if only we had valued (in dollars) the service of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration of the forest of the Congo Basin, and if we had valued the service of protecting coastlines from erosion of the coral reefs in Melanesia, the market would have fixed this issue. So from this overall narrative it is easy to get the impression that when the IPCC talks about adaptation, it means that the people will adapt, but the market will stay, and might even save us from doom if we don’t stand in the way. It is in these moments that I wish that the IPCC had an additional working group; working group 0: “How did we get here?”. An analysis of how (mostly) the capitalist economic system through constant demand for capital accumulation and growth created massive inequalities and systematically shifted the social and ecological cost of their activities to the environment and future generations.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The current reports do not answer this question. And indeed, they barely mention capitalism. In the full report of AR6 WGII “capitalism” is mentioned 3 times.

In working group III “capitalism” is mentioned once in the body of the full report. And of course any mention of “capitalism” or “imperialism” is nowhere to be found when we look in the technical summaries (the shorter summary of the full report) and the summary for policy makers (an even shorter report that for working group II and working group III is approved line by line by IPCC member governments).</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn46"><p><sup>46</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="ipccwg2">H.-O.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>A similar exercise can be done with the word “degrowth”. Degrowth is a policy and a set of theories that critique the paradigm of economic growth.

Still, the chapter falls shorts of exploring system-wide strategies and instead of championing an overhaul of capitalism (as degrowth does), it mostly focuses on individual strategies such as going vegan<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn48"><p><sup>48</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="demand_side"><span>“<span class="nocase">Sufficiency means degrowth – Timothée Parrique</span>”</span> (<a href="#ref-demand_side" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span></p></li><li id="fn49"><p><sup>49</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="demand_side"><span>“<span class="nocase">Sufficiency means degrowth – Timothée Parrique</span>”</span> (<a href="#ref-demand_side" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span></p></li></div></div>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="individual-vs-systemic">Individual vs systemic</h2>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Within the discourse of solutions to climate change, usually the division between individual and systemic actions is invoked. I believe this to be a good distinction, but it is also important to distinguish between principled solutions and opportunistic ones. Regarding the latter, opportunism goes beyond greenwashing and can apply to progressive sounding ideas. For example, healing from consumerism and adopting a “1.5 degree lifestyle”<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> is not only an inadequate advice, but it is also contradictory because the 1.5 degree lifestyle itself can become commodified and something to be marketed to a “progressive” market demographic. An example of such suggestion can be found in “The climate book” (which I overall recommend, as it provides accurate and up to date information on climate change), where the author of the chapter 5.3 proudly proclaims that they renounced to their private vehicle, and rely now on a car sharing service. These type of advice not only seem to be sponsored content, but they are targeted only to the affluent metropolitan worker of the Global North. Similar types of opportunism are excessive focus on individual carbon footprint to the detriment of systemic solutions. The individual carbon footprint is a concept that was promoted by British Petroleum in the early 2000s to shift the responsibility of carbon emission to the individual<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>, and therefore cannot be the sole focus of the climate activist. Before moving on to systemic solutions I want to mention that of course there are individual actions that can have a positive influence and can be adopted by well-off people such as stopping flying, eating vegan<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> and reducing consumption.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn52"><p><sup>52</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="climate_book">Thunberg (<a href="#ref-climate_book" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;462</p></li><li id="fn53"><p><sup>53</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="climate_book">Thunberg (<a href="#ref-climate_book" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;520</p></li><li id="fn54"><p><sup>54</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="climate_book">Thunberg (<a href="#ref-climate_book" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;472</p></li></div></div>

<p>People who insist on the need to work within the system fundamentally do not understand the incentive structures that created the present day inequalities (in historical CO<sub>2</sub> emission or wages). You end up with an army of self-appointed progressives stumbling over each other to provide a “nuanced” critique of the present economic system and passing it as radical. This if how nonsense such as green growth, or “1.5 degree lifestyles” become part of the mainstream discourse around climate change. You can also end up with good-faith actors demanding “the north should pay for the cost of climate justice”, but that fail to understand the dynamics of today’s global capitalism. A demand like that is essentially analogous to say “business owners are much richer than the workers that work for them. They should therefore divide their wealth equally”. In order to provide a principled critique and actual solution to our climate crisis, it is necessary to systemically criticize capitalism. I don’t believe that an in-depth understanding of capitalism is a condition to be a supporter of climate justice, but it is fundamental to avoid common pitfalls.</p>

It is not intended to be a comprehensive or complete description and I encourage anybody interested to check the references for more details. The purpose of this part is to explain how the present day inequalities are not an accident, but an intended feature of the global capitalist system, a system that requires incessant growth and expansion and is therefore not only fully compatible with, but necessitates imperialism. Today we live in a divided world with divided classes, with the clearest examples of this phenomenon being the massive differentials in wages or historical CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The story of capitalism is fundamentally intertwined with colonialism and imperialism. It is crucial to stress that colonialism, the expansion and oversea territorial control by European powers, provided the momentum for capital accumulation<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a>, which was key to catalyze the first industrial revolution. Specifically, the plundering of the Americas played a pivotal role as the silver robbed from South America end up first in Spain and then in rest of Europe as repayment for Spain’s debts. Additionally, the surplus population created by the agrarian revolution in England found employment largely in sectors that presupposed the existence of colonies, such as the building of ships and harbors among others. The workers that could not find employment domestically were dispossessed to the colonies as settlers or indentured servants<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>. I will not go into an in depth description of how imperialism and colonialism enabled the development of capitalism because of lack of specific expertise and I instead refer to books such as “How the West Came to Rule”, “How Europe Underdeveloped Africa” and the “Colonial Tribute” chapter of the book “The Wealth of (Some) Nations”.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn61"><p><sup>61</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="blaut">Blaut (<a href="#ref-blaut" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;105; cf. <span class="citation" data-cites="wosn">Cope (<a href="#ref-wosn" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> p.&nbsp;35</p></li><li id="fn62"><p><sup>62</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="how_the_west">Anievas and Nişancıoğlu (<a href="#ref-how_the_west" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> p.&nbsp;151</p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Nowadays we are often told a myth of western industrialization through brilliance. According to this story, Western Europe and North America developed as a function of superior technology, governance and institutions.

These idealistic explanations, assume ideas to be the dominant driver of history and ignore the deeply uneven relationship in the last half a millennium between North and South. It is a convenient story that depoliticizes global inequality and takes power relations out of the economy. The inequality that we observe today among countries (in wages or historical CO<sub>2</sub> emissions) are largely the result of the colonialism of yesterday. The last 500 years of relationship between the North and South were mostly characterized by violent appropriation of means of production, robbery, thievery and usurpation of system of governance and way of life.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn63"><p><sup>63</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="weber">Weber (<a href="#ref-weber" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span></p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Just to briefly mention one example among many; India, under British imperialism was the subject of British capitalist exploitation without being allowed to reap the fruits of capitalist development.

The drain of Indian economy was carried out through the destruction of the domestic handicraft sector and by the application of exorbitant taxes and monopoly prices on imports from England to India. The colonial market was kept obligatory open while the metropolitan market was protected with high tariffs against rival products such as Asian textiles. Therefore, India developed not according the needs of the Indian people, but as market for British manufactures and as a supplier to Britain of raw materials.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The end of formal colonialism carried the hope that formerly subjugated countries could finally develop independently. Spearhead by South American countries such as Chile, Argentina and Uruguay in late 1940s and 1950s, and later adopted by newly independent countries in Africa such as Ghana, Tanzania among others in the 1960s, a new type of economic development, inspired by Keynesian economics took place<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>. Encouraged by the success of the Soviet economy and by the fast growth of centralized European economies after WWII, they established a “development inward” type of economy, defined “developmentalism”, in which the state played an active part in the economy. A key aspect of developmentalism was the policy “Import Substitution Industrialization”, which was characterized by state subsidies aimed at developing strategic industries and by trade barriers to protect the nascent domestic production. Foreign capital flows were discouraged and foreign ownership of national assets was limited, often even nationalizing natural resources and key industries. Additionally, strong investments in public education, healthcare, social security and housing strongly reduced poverty and supported workers<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a>. Developmentalism was widely successful in reducing the gap between rich and poor countries. Within a decade the income gap between USA and East Asia shrank by 26%, between US and Latin America by 11% and in the middle East by 23%. Additionally, new forms of international cooperation among Global South countries started to take place with the formation of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn67"><p><sup>67</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="the_divide">Hickel (<a href="#ref-the_divide" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;109</p></li><li id="fn68"><p><sup>68</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="the_divide">Hickel (<a href="#ref-the_divide" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;111</p></li><li id="fn69"><p><sup>69</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="the_divide">Hickel (<a href="#ref-the_divide" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;113</p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>What followed this impressive level of development was a series of coups supported by Western Governments (mostly USA, Britain and France) who felt threatened by lack of control on “developing” countries economies. Import substitution industrialization had effectively made consumer goods in the North more expensive, whereas capital controls and higher taxes were cutting on their profits. The following is an incomplete list of western-backed coups aimed at overthrowing democratically elected leaders who wished to independently develop their economies, and that were replaced by dictators loyal to western commercial interests. The United States government, through the CIA aided the overthrown of the following leaders: Mohammad Mosaddegh in Iran in 1953<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a> (also aided by Britain), Jacobo Árbenz in Guatemala in 1954<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a>, Patrice Lumumba in the Republic of the Congo in 1961 (orchestrated by Belgium), João Goulart in Brazil in 1964 (also assisted by Britain), Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana in 1966<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a>, Sukarno in Indonesia in 1967 and Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a>.

France also played a large role intervening in the elections of countries that had been under its colonial power. France rigged Cameroon first election in 1982, picked the first president of Gabon in 1961. Additionally, Thomas Sankara, the revolutionary leader of Burkina Faso, was murdered in 1987 by a rival faction who was against Sankara’s anti-imperialist stance in regards to French interests.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn70"><p><sup>70</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="the_divide">Hickel (<a href="#ref-the_divide" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;113</p></li><li id="fn71"><p><sup>71</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="the_divide">Hickel (<a href="#ref-the_divide" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;115</p></li><li id="fn72"><p><sup>72</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="the_divide">Hickel (<a href="#ref-the_divide" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;119</p></li><li id="fn73"><p><sup>73</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="the_divide">Hickel (<a href="#ref-the_divide" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;129</p></li><li id="fn74"><p><sup>74</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="the_divide">Hickel (<a href="#ref-the_divide" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;118</p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>During the neoliberal era that followed, debt became the western weapon of choice to both fight domestic stagnation and to push their interest abroad. The 1970s was characterized by a spectacular increase in loans to developing countries, often to dictatorships the US helped install, and therefore whose population had not a say in the matter<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a>. As the loans were denominated in dollars, with variable interest rates, many indebted countries had to default when federal fund rates hit a record 21% in 1981. What followed was a series of bailouts by the IMF in return for structural adjustment programs (SAPs), which essentially means that subjected countries had to radically deregulate their economies. SAPs were characterized by austerity, privatization and liberalization and beyond being extremely detrimental for the poor, were also undemocratic as essentially Western creditors had control of the economy of developing countries, disregarding national sovereignty<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn75"><p><sup>75</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="the_divide">Hickel (<a href="#ref-the_divide" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;150</p></li><li id="fn76"><p><sup>76</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="the_divide">Hickel (<a href="#ref-the_divide" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;153</p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Debt is not the only mean of economic control. Most sectors today are monopolized by a few multinational companies whose headquarters reside in the Global North. A monopolistic position allows for price-fixing, and repatriation of profits. The vast majorities of commodities in labor intensive industries are produced by workers in the Global South, who are paid depressed wages. Both the labor and the commodities produced in the South are undervalued, but as soon as the commodity enters the Northern market its price is multiplied by several fold<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a>. Meanwhile most of the North’s agricultural consumption originates in the South. An estimated 1 billion farmers (of which 85% are small scale) produce half the world food at very low price, while being charged exorbitant prices for fertilizers, seeds and pesticides<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a>. The combination of undervaluing of Southern products and predatory loans has contributed to super-exploitation and continued dependency of the Global South even after the end of formal colonization. A “new international division of labor” has emerged. The majority of production (and therefore actual value added) is taking place in the South, whereas the jobs involving design, patent rights, organization of supply chain and distribution of the final product are monopolized by the North<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a>. This polarized world where the South is organized around a production economy and the North around a consumption economy has created differences in wages that can be up to a factor of 10<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a>. Inequality today is not mostly based by class, but driven by location, which contributes to 80% of global inequality.

What could the difference in wages be caused by? I can already image people pointing to the supposedly higher productivity in the North.

In fact often workers in the South are more productive than workers in the North<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a>. In truth, the difference is based on the forces described above; the monopolies of force, industries and finance. The militarized borders and the continuing economic dependency of the South<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a>.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="degrowth">Degrowth</h2>
<p>Capitalism has created immense poverty and unimaginable inequalities between North and South. While a few “lucky” are living large off the spoils of imperialism almost a billion people are hungry. And the excessive consumption in the North is not taking place in the ether, but requires utilization of materials and production of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It requires net appropriation from the South, the draining of the resources of poor countries and the offshoring of the cost of growth to vulnerable communities. It has needed the colonization and the systematic undervaluing of human lives and labor and requires today the colonization of the atmosphere.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The goal of the Paris agreement is to keep temperature increase well below 2°C and to pursue 1.5°C. The unfortunate truth is that 1.5°C is dead and 2°C is moribund. With the current government policies a median warming of 3.2°C is predicted by 2100<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a>.

Capitalism requires constant growth for the sake of capital accumulation and somehow this idea has become accepted as common sense, as a sensible way of organizing human activity. This ideology is of course very popular within the political right, but also within the liberal left the delusion that we can heal the planet and improve living conditions, human health and happiness within the paradigm of continuous growth and private ownership of the means of production is widespread<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a>. Capitalism requires on average a compound growth rate of 3% per year. That means a doubling of GDP every 24 years and a tenfold increase every 78 years. And we shouldn’t forget that growth under capitalism is exploitative; it requires the exploitation of marginalized groups and it needs large amounts of unpaid labor necessary for social reproduction, which have been historically largely carried out by women. Even proponents of so called “green growth” admit that at some point growth has to stop increasing, just conveniently not in the near future<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98" role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a>.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Green growth relies on the decoupling of GDP from carbon emissions (more about this in the Climate Leviathan chapter). It envisions a techno-utopia in which we will shortly achieve massive improvements in technology that will allow humanity to transition to green energy production, while keeping economic growth intact. At the center of the green growth paradigm are bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technologies. These negative emissions forms of energy productions are promising and exciting, but it is not proven if they can scale up and would require biofuel plantation the size of 3 Indias<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a>. Green growth is palatable to Western European and North American because it does not ask for a radical change and maintains the energy privilege of the Global North. Yes, it is theoretically possible to decarbonize energy production while keeping growth, but not fast enough to avoid catastrophic climate change<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100" role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a>. There is also the additional problem that keeping growth means increasing energy demand, which would further add to the challenge of decarbonizing the energy sector. Furthermore, transitioning to clean energy requires an energy investment, the so called “CO<sub>2</sub> bump”. It follows, that if growth continues, the more energy will be required and the larger the “bump”<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101" role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn99"><p><sup>99</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="degrowth_yt">OxfordSmithSchool (<a href="#ref-degrowth_yt" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span></p></li><li id="fn100"><p><sup>100</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="what_degrowth_mean">Hickel (<a href="#ref-what_degrowth_mean" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span></p></li><li id="fn101"><p><sup>101</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="pgnd">Ajl (<a href="#ref-pgnd" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;90</p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The alternative is a future not constrained by the necessity for growth. “Degrowth” recognizes that the only way to avoid the most extreme consequences of climate change is to reduce in the high-income countries the level of production and consumption<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102" role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a>. It consists in a planned downscaling of energy and resource throughput by diminishing the parts of the economy which are more ecological destructive and socially unnecessary. Current economies are too concerned on GDP and not enough on humans needs. GDP assesses the welfare of capitalism, not people. Degrowth advocates to stop fetishizing GDP and re-focus the economy on concrete objectives, such as education, healthcare, housing etc. It argues that essential services need to be expanded and decommodified<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a>, so that we wouldn’t have to overly rely on private income to lead fulfilling lives.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn102"><p><sup>102</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="what_degrowth_mean">Hickel (<a href="#ref-what_degrowth_mean" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span></p></li><li id="fn103"><p><sup>103</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="degrowth_yt">OxfordSmithSchool (<a href="#ref-degrowth_yt" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span></p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Degrowth is an old idea for a new and challenging time. Degrowth is by definition anti-capitalist; it is socialism without growth.

Chauvinist positions among self-appointed socialists are not a new phenomenon.

Some even indulge in the same blind faith of technological progress and dream of a “Fully Automated Luxury Communism” where machines do all the work and humanity can enter the gates of a post-work paradise.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>It is important to point out that degrowth does not envision a reduction of growth in the Global South, where in fact an expansion of energy use is needed to meet human needs. Degrowth in the North is necessary not only to keep within acceptable levels of global temperature increase, but also to reduce global inequality. Degrowth in the North would curb unequal exchange and therefore reduce the transfer of value from the South to the North. An additional key aspect of degrowth is the cancellation of most debt from low and middle-income countries<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a>. Many forms of debts are illegitimate because they were pushed by institutions under extremely uneven power dynamics or because they were accepted by despotic regimes.

<p>Proponents of degrowth argue that this transformation in the North does not automatically mean a reduction of living standards, but rather a re-organization of the economy around human needs. A Northern post-growth society would require a reduction of the working week, the introduction of work guarantee with a living wage, democratization of the workplaces and punishing wealth taxes for the ultra-rich.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Most objection around degrowth revolve around feasibility<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a>. Degrowth is often dismissed by pragmatist as politically impossible or unfeasible. But as Max Ajl eloquently says “Feasible is the watchword of reaction and a talisman of oppression”<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a>. Too many in the North are content with the status quo and are scared of appearing too “political”. Given a choice between social democracy based on economic imperialism and right wing populism they choose the apolitical center. However, keeping the status quo is a political choice. Deciding to keep intact large scale private property regimes is a political choice. Choosing to struggle is also a political decision<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a>. And struggle we must, because systems of power do not fall by their own, especially when it is not just the famous 1% that benefits from the current economic arrangement, but it is also the Northern labor aristocracy who lacks a material interest in abolishing their privilege.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn108"><p><sup>108</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="degrowth_yt">OxfordSmithSchool (<a href="#ref-degrowth_yt" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span></p></li><li id="fn109"><p><sup>109</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="pgnd">Ajl (<a href="#ref-pgnd" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;22</p></li><li id="fn110"><p><sup>110</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="pgnd">Ajl (<a href="#ref-pgnd" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;87</p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Any rational person would say that despite the Northern sensibilities and the purported desire to live in equitable world, the material incentives to keep the current inequalities are just too strong. And that was my position as well, when I started to write this article. However, it is important to not make a fatal assumption. Yes, Northern workers currently receive economic benefits, mostly in the form of higher purchasing power, but money does not equal human welfare. The fact that we have associated GDP growth to human wellbeing is the symptom of capital hegemony on culture<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a>.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>There are however issues with the implementation of degrowth that have to be discussed. Reducing working time in the North, while keeping the same salary would be an artificial way to further increase the North’s “productivity”. A world in which people in the North work 20 hours a week and have lots of leisure time, while the majority of the Southern workers toil 60 hours a week is not acceptable. Additionally, if degrowth is established only in one country, companies spooked by the change in regime might just move their capital overseas, where better conditions for profit making are present<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a>; the so-called “first mover” problem.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn112"><p><sup>112</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="degrowth_can_work">Hickel, Kallis, et al.

<p>Climate change is a global problem and therefore necessitates solutions that go beyond the national borders. It is here that we enter in the realm of sovereignty and specifically international sovereignty. Joel Wainwright and Geoff Mann in their excellent book “Climate Leviathan” argue that out of the global crisis of climate change a global sovereign will emerge to manage the emergency. The nature of this sovereign is impossible to predict right now, but there is no reason to believe that it has deterministically to be an anti-capitalist force. In other words, in absence of degrowth the world it is not going to end, it is just going to be much worse than now. That is because capitalism, as a system, has an incentive to take actions against climate change. Not enough to guarantee a decent life for everybody, of course, but just enough to keep the system going.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-climate-leviathan">A Climate Leviathan</h2>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Within the context of climate change is it worth to ask: Where do national governments and supernational institutions drawn their legitimacy to act? The philosopher Thomas Hobbes in 1651 answers this questions by sketching out the social contract. Hobbes imagines the emergence of government out of the desire by man to leave the state of nature; a condition characterized by conflict and violence and where life would be “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short”<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a>. So men surrender some of their freedom to an authority defined the Leviathan in exchange for stability and security. The Leviathan can be an authoritarian leader or a government elected by the majority, but it usually emerges from a period of crisis. Out of the confusion and panic of emergency the Leviathan appears and swiftly acts to restore the social order. Even in liberal democracies, when there is an emergency and there is the need to act, freedoms are suspended and the sovereign acts, often with the consent of the governed, to protect the people<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a>. Think about the PATRIOT act in the USA post 9/11 or the lockdowns imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. They were unprecedented restrictions of freedom legitimized by an acute crisis. Governments often invoke the state of emergency during natural disasters or armed conflicts to rapidly put in place policies that would not normally be allowed to go through. So in periods of peace and stability the “Leviathan is never dead; it merely hibernates”<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115" role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn113"><p><sup>113</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="hobbes">Hobbes (<a href="#ref-hobbes" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> XIII.9</p></li><li id="fn114"><p><sup>114</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="agamben">Agamben (<a href="#ref-agamben" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span></p></li><li id="fn115"><p><sup>115</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="climate_leviathan">Wainwright and Mann (<a href="#ref-climate_leviathan" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;38</p></li></div></div>
<p>Wainwright and Mann posit two main conditions that will shape how future societies might organize in the face of climate change. The first revolves around the economic organization and specifically if economic formations will be capitalist or not. The second condition is whether planetary sovereignty will emerge. A coherent global sovereign can exist only if capable of invoking an exception, declaring an emergency and deciding who may or may not emit carbon. Within this conditions they define a capitalist “Climate Leviathan” and an anti-capitalist “Climate Mao”. But global sovereignty in the face of climate change is not a given. In fact a reactionary capitalist “Climate Behemoth” might emerge, united by nationalist sentiments and unwilling to sacrifice liberty for lower CO<sub>2</sub> emission. Finally they sketch an anti-capitalist, anti-sovereign “Climate X”; a self-admitted utopic future, so hard to imagine that an X is put as a placeholder for what it might be.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Given the absolute dominance nowadays of capitalism and the emergence of forms of supernational sovereignty, Wainwright and Mann predict that the most likely response to climate change will take the form of Climate Leviathan. They define it as: “a regulatory authority armed with democratic legitimacy, binding technical authority on scientific issues, and a panopticon-like capacity to monitor the vital granular elements of our emerging world: fresh water, carbon emissions, climate refugees, and so on”<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn116"><p><sup>116</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="climate_leviathan">Wainwright and Mann (<a href="#ref-climate_leviathan" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;47</p></li></div></div>

In fact it admits its own failures, by acknowledging that the intended emissions contributions will not fall within the 2°C threshold<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a>. And yet Paris and COP serve a different function. They are the institutional manifestations of a Climate Leviathan in formation.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>A similar stubbornness has historically been showed towards the theory of planetary motion. Geocentrism as described by the Ptolemaic system was actually able to predict fairly accurately planetary movement, but it had to assume very odd orbits where planets slowed down, stopped, and moved backward in retrograde motion, and then again reversed to resume normal motion; mathematically these curve are called “epitrochoids”<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121" role="doc-noteref"><sup>121</sup></a>.

Note that neoclassical economy, never truly developed a theory of value, but rather a theory of price which is determined at point of consumption through the concept of marginal utility. The “value” of the forest service, such as carbon assimilation through photosynthesis, is therefore determined by the demand for the service and by the magnitude of the service. As a specialist in ecology and remote sensing I often thought that one can spend all of their career trying to perfect algorithms and models to better estimate photosynthesis from space, only to have contributed to enable a system of exclusion and expropriation incentivized by profit.</p>
<p>REDD+ is a framework that provides payment for carbon offsets, which can be traded in the market. At the moment it is a fragmented program which relies on the voluntary carbon market, but could be significantly expanded in case of scientific advancements regarding the monitoring of forest carbon flows. Additionally, in order to become a truly global project, a central authority (a Leviathan) would need to allocate a maximum amount of carbon credits to member countries, in effect regulating access to the atmosphere.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Despite the enthusiasm, often the people living inside the forests have been unconvinced. Communities of Indigenous People living in the Peruvian Amazon have reported immense pressure to waive their rights to the land to enable a REDD project which they have described as “carbon piracy”<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126" role="doc-noteref"><sup>126</sup></a>. Often there is no community consultation or it occurs after high level decision has already taken place. In many REDD+ projects the indigenous population has experienced land grabs, violent expropriation and forced adjudication of carbon rights<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127" role="doc-noteref"><sup>127</sup></a>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn126"><p><sup>126</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="palgrave_imperialism">Ness and Cope (<a href="#ref-palgrave_imperialism" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;466</p></li><li id="fn127"><p><sup>127</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="emission_trading">Bond (<a href="#ref-emission_trading" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span></p></li></div></div>
<p>Under colonial and post-colonial circumstances, people living in resource-rich areas have been systematically expropriated and dispossessed. Now that forest are starting to obtain a monetary value besides that of its timber, the same process of expulsion and extraction is continuing.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Finally, the last epitrochoid of green capitalism and definite marker denoting the rise of a global sovereign is solar radiation management (SRM). The most researched version of SRM is stratospheric aerosol injection, which would involve artificially increasing the level of aerosols in the stratosphere to increase the atmospheric albedo and induce a cooling effect. One of the proposed ways for this method would be to deliver with high-altitude balloons sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) in the stratosphere which would combine with oxygen and water to form aqueous sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), subsequently condensating on existing aerosols particles<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128" role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a>. Besides the concerns related to uneven distribution of impacts, and uncertain ecological consequences, such an intervention would require sovereignty over the whole planet. Only a fully formed Leviathan would have the authority to call the emergency and carry out the geoengineering. Stratospheric sulfur aerosols lifetime depends on the altitude at which are injected, but is less than 2 years<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129" role="doc-noteref"><sup>129</sup></a>. SRM would then be a procedure that needs to be carried out regularly, as if the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration continued to rise a sudden stop in SRM would cause a very rapid increase in temperatures and therefore runaway climate change with devastating consequences<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130" role="doc-noteref"><sup>130</sup></a>.

<p>In fact in the core there seems to be a resurgence of enthusiasm for Green Keynesianism, with progressives supporting increased government spending to boost the green economy, create green jobs and lead by example in adoption of sustainable technologies. Examples of this push are the American “Green New Deal” and the “European Green Deal”, that differ in their ambition and implementation but have in common an expansion of the welfare state with an emphasis on green technology.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The Green New Deal is a policy proposal put forth by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Edward Markey in early November 2018.

It is also considering to maybe stop subsiding fossil fuels. According to the EU Green Deal a reduction of 40% of emissions between 2019 and 2030 is planned. Even though there are serious doubts that this is going to be achieved, it would still be way less than the 57% cut between 2019 and 2030 (calculated for the whole World) in emissions which would be required to have a 66% probability of staying below 1.5°C of warming by 2100, with little or no overshoot<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137" role="doc-noteref"><sup>137</sup></a>.

China, with its mixed socialist market economy, characterized by both state-owned enterprises and a large private sector could very well end up supporting a capitalist Climate Leviathan. Although the private sector in China has been growing, especially among large companies<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143" role="doc-noteref"><sup>143</sup></a>, China is a country governed by a communist party that considers the teachings of Marx paramount.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) considers China to be in the first stage of socialism, and as such the CCP judged that it was necessary to open up and liberalize the economy to some extent in the past four decades in order to expand the productive forces.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>If China in next decades achieves the goal of becoming a fully socialist country, while maintaining economic hegemony, it could lead the formation of what Wainwright and Mann define a “Climate Mao”; a global anti-capitalist sovereign armed with the legitimacy to take the necessary steps to tackle the threat of climate change. Climate Mao could have the capacity to coordinate massive amount of people quickly. It would represent a top coordinated bottom-up approach to the threat of climate change. Examples of this type of coordination can be found by looking at China during the COVID-19 response, in the massive state led engineering of the air quality in Beijing during the 2008 winter Olympics<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147" role="doc-noteref"><sup>147</sup></a>, in the Chinese great green wall project to combat desertification or in the push from the Chinese health ministry to encourage new dietary guidelines.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn147"><p><sup>147</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="ozone">Wang et al.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The name Climate Mao underlines the belief by Wainwright and Mann that a potential anti-capitalist sovereign would rise in Asia, and not in other regions of the world that are also characterized by a resistance to capital and empire such as South America. That is because Asia not only has large states overseeing massive economies, but also possesses revolutionary histories and ideologies that can be mobilized for revolutionary action<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148" role="doc-noteref"><sup>148</sup></a>. Additionally, China (and East Asia in general) is very vulnerable to climate change, especially with regards to extreme heat and floods, both having a negative effect on food security<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149" role="doc-noteref"><sup>149</sup></a>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn148"><p><sup>148</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="climate_leviathan">Wainwright and Mann (<a href="#ref-climate_leviathan" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;61</p></li><li id="fn149"><p><sup>149</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="ipccwg2">H.-O.

The climate emergency could require China to return to a Maoist or New Maoist revolutionary program. Mao era massive mobilization such as the Great Leap Forward and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are instances in which an incredible amount of power was put into the hands of proletarian and students.

<p>Inside the CCP there is a large Maoist faction, but Maoism is on the rise also in the “red corridor” in India, in the Philippines and in Nepal. Within China the working class and the peasantry will play a massive role in defining which direction the CPP will take. The CCP, contrary to common beliefs, is somewhat responsive to people demands and requires a broad support to maintain its legitimacy. The protest against the zero-covid restrictions in November 2022 and the rapid response from the government to change policy is an example, although rare, of civic engagement and popular influence on national policies.</p>
<p>Currently China is believed to be on track to support the rise of a capitalist Climate Leviathan. Whether a bottom-up class struggle, fueled by changes in material conditions due to climate change, will take place in China —in direct contradiction with the CPP’s desire of maintaining “social harmony”— is going to determine if a formation such as Climate Mao will emerge.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>If a concept such as Climate Mao seems very far and removed from the common imagination, the virulent reaction to even the seeds of global sovereignty —whether capitalist or not— is already very present nowadays. Climate Behemoth is the formation that can rise from the hyper-nationalist suspicion of all internationalist formations that can regulate sovereignty and national capital or can empower international elites. Reactionary Behemoth would try to block the ascension of a Leviathan because of the aversion to the liberal pretension to rational world government<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151" role="doc-noteref"><sup>151</sup></a>, as well as the desire to not sacrifice individual liberty for lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Some manifestation of Behemoth clearly showed themselves in a few right-wing populist leaders such as Trump, Modi, Bolsonaro and Orban. The base of support for Behemoth is very broad; along with the most reactionary facets of big business, such as fossil fuel industry, also large parts of the middle class of the North, especially small and medium business owners conscious of their privileges have a stake in supporting nationalistic and protectionist policies.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn151"><p><sup>151</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="climate_leviathan">Wainwright and Mann (<a href="#ref-climate_leviathan" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;64</p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Another source of support comes from the most reactionary elements of the working class, often part of ethnic or religious majorities that did not strongly benefit from globalization. The new division of labor associated with transnational capitalism has impoverished the South, but in the North the benefits have been distributed unequally. Because of the outsourcing of jobs many people, especially white and male, that were accustomed to be at the top of the social and ethnic ladder are rapidly and visibly losing their privilege. This is usually accompanied with a shift to right wing nationalism and fascism and a rejection of neoliberalism and globalization<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152" role="doc-noteref"><sup>152</sup></a> (usually referred as “globalism” in right wing circles).</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn152"><p><sup>152</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="wosn">Cope (<a href="#ref-wosn" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;280</p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Today neofascism has even an insurrection-like component as demonstrated by the Capitol riots of January 6th 2021 and can even develop antagonistic relationships with institutions that have historically worked to protect the privileges of their base, such as the police, FBI etc. Of course fascism never fundamentally threatens the property relations, it just redirects anger towards marginalized populations that are used as scapegoats such as immigrants. It has to be said that often within fascism there is a pseudo-left component, where an anti-immigrant rhetoric is accompanied by a purported desire to protect domestic workers as long as it’s at the expense of “inferior” races or nations<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153" role="doc-noteref"><sup>153</sup></a>. In fact, there can be even a convergence in aims from the right-wing populist with left-wing nationalist as they can both share the same anti-interventionist, anti-globalization and often anti-immigrants language. A good example of this alignment can be observed in the tough-on-immigration comments from Bernie Sanders during his campaign that found strong agreement with the Trump voter<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154" role="doc-noteref"><sup>154</sup></a>. It is important to point out that left-wing nationalism mainly aims at improving the redistribution of wealth —often dependent on economic imperialism— within the country, and is therefore very different from an internationalist socialist movement which prioritizes class over nation.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn153"><p><sup>153</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="wosn">Cope (<a href="#ref-wosn" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;280</p></li><li id="fn154"><p><sup>154</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="vox">Vox (<a href="#ref-vox" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span></p></li></div></div>
<p>Behemoth’s concerns about the loss of national sovereignty in the face of massive climate migration will certainly intensify its fascist tendencies. So in a Behemoth dominated future we could expect larger and taller walls, an increase in economic protectionism and further paranoia about internal and external enemies. One area where Behemoth would still welcome international cooperation is defense. Although the anti-interventionist rhetoric, for Behemoth is preferable to use violence to “persuade” adversaries rather than lose its economic dominance.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>A Climate Behemoth will surely be the most dangerous response to climate change; it wouldn’t even attempt to find solutions to the climate crisis as it would be limited by the suspicion of any type of internationalist collaboration.

<p>What is left? A world to build, but first to imagine. Wainwright and Mann do their best to describe Climate X, an anti-capitalist, anti-sovereign formation that can adequately respond to climate change, but the picture remains blurry. It is our responsibility to contribute to define it, because fighting against a system can only take us so far. The name “X” is a placeholder for something that still has to be created.

It is a very narrow concept that translates to the freedom of the few to exploit and privatize the social labor of many. Capitalism produces inequality and unfreedom by design, and needs the state to guarantee the protection of private property. X realizes this and can therefore be born only out of a struggle against capitalism and sovereignty. The two are of course linked<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157" role="doc-noteref"><sup>157</sup></a>; The state or supernational authority has historically been used as an instrument of class oppression, but for our purposes it is useful to keep them separate, to highlight the dual nature of the fight ahead.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn157"><p><sup>157</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="red_menace">Escalante and O’Shea (<a href="#ref-red_menace" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span></p></li></div></div>
<p>So here is my how-to-guide to get closer to X, built on top of the great work of Wainwright &amp; Mann; it is a two step process that aims at tackling both capital and sovereignty.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Against the unfreedom of poverty created by capital, equality, inclusion and dignity of all<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158" role="doc-noteref"><sup>158</sup></a>. The starting point is to realize the vast inequality existing today among countries, and the mechanisms responsible for it; imperialism and colonialism motivated by the need to expand into markets that could be coerced through violence into submission. The same system that requires ever expansion in growth and consumption has already massively altered the climate and is leading us to ecological collapse. The material personification of the contradictions within capitalism. It is our responsibility to understand the system that created this inequality and work for its overthrown. For this, a theoretical understanding and critique of capitalism is paramount and can be found within the Marxist tradition; Marx himself, along with more contemporary intellectuals that developed the analysis to more explicitly tackle imperialism and colonialism, such as Samir Amin and Immanuel Wallerstein. However, it is fundamental to go beyond criticism and provide a feasible alternative. I believe degrowth to be the way forward, to tackle both the climate and exploitation crisis. It may require losing in the North the privileges obtained by the continuous undervaluing of land, ecosystems and labor from the South, but more than that it would require a re-organization of the way of life. A shift of priorities, where food, housing, education and healthcare for all come first and profit is second or eliminated entirely. It is not an easy task and requires a bottom-up push from conscious, organized and angry masses, not content with the status quo. As for everything, education is the first step of action, and therefore I am going to leave here a list of books that I think have the potential to shift perceptions and kickstart change. “Climate Leviathan” by Joel Wainwright and Geoff Mann, “A People’s Green New Deal” by Max Ajl, “The Divide” by Jason Hickel and “The Wealth of (Some) Nations” by Zak Cope.</p></li>
<li><p>Against sovereignty, a planetary vision shaped by solidarity to compose a world where many worlds fit. These principles are grounded from the struggles of climate justice that emerge from all over the world, mostly from marginalized communities. There is much to learn from “the knowledge and lifeways of peoples who have long historical experience with ways of being that are not overdetermined by capital and the sovereign state”<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159" role="doc-noteref"><sup>159</sup></a>. What follows is a series of examples from several communities within the American continent that are struggling for autonomy. They present different characteristics and particularities, but I believe that what unites them is their fight against sovereignty.</p></li>

Their battle against neoliberalism, which in their case took concrete shape with the NAFTA agreement, aims at resisting the market forces that leave people landless, impoverished and stripped away of their identity. The Zapatistas did not wish Indigenous People to separate themselves from Mexico, rather they wanted to be “recognized as an integral part of the country, but with their particularities“<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160" role="doc-noteref"><sup>160</sup></a>. They aim to place indigenous lands, rich in dignity and history (but also petroleum and uranium) at the disposal of people and not capital.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>In a different part of the American continent, radical (from the West view) indigenous thinkers have grounded a powerful critique of sovereignty and extractivism on the basis of the concept of mother nature; a goddess which is central to the cosmogony of many Indigenous Peoples in South America.

Their oil wells are a violation of our mother, they are taking her blood. In addition, the government has not fulfilled its commitments to title the land, to bring us health and to withdraw military forces from our territory, they are killing us little by little. We have been in meetings for several years and you have not done anything, we no longer trust your minutes and documents. We want you to leave and to respect our autonomy over the reservation.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The concept of mother nature, or mother Earth, was also central to the World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth which took place in Cochabamba in 2010. The People’s agreement<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164" role="doc-noteref"><sup>164</sup></a> that resulted is a powerful document that challenges the logic of progress, competition and limitless growth that is taken from granted at the United Nations Climate Change Conferences. By explicitly starting from the rights of mother Earth, the Peoples’ agreement offers a robust alternative to the western conception of nature, where its services are considered valuable only when monetized and traded in the market.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn164"><p><sup>164</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="cochabamba"><span>“<span class="nocase">People’s Agreement of Cochabamba</span>”</span> (<a href="#ref-cochabamba" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span></p></li></div></div>
<p>In yet another example of indigenous struggle for self-determination, the Mapuche people of Chile and Argentina have been fighting for decades, not to have their rights written on a piece of paper, but for concrete direct access to their land.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>“Land, in the Mapuche struggle, is a transcendent concept. It is not simply a plot of terra firma demarcated by a set of boundaries, as it is in the liberal Enlightenment thinking that constitutes the earth-hating religion of the West. Land is a living, inalienable thing that serves as the basis for the community’s existence”<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165" role="doc-noteref"><sup>165</sup></a>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn165"><p><sup>165</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="mapuche">Severino (<a href="#ref-mapuche" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span></p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>In another instance of refusal to compromise, the Mapuche are not willing to sign agreements with the Chilean or Argentinian state or with oil companies such as Chevron, thirsty to exploit their land for oil extraction. They are taking their land by employing protest, blockades and also economic sabotage which resulted in terrorism charges from the Chilean government. According to the IPCC, Indigenous Peoples can provide invaluable knowledge for successful adaptation to climate change and for socio-ecological resilience<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166" role="doc-noteref"><sup>166</sup></a>. From the IPCC: “Different actors, the private sector and civil society, influenced by science, local and Indigenous knowledges, and the media, are both active and passive in designing and navigating climate resilient development pathways”<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167" role="doc-noteref"><sup>167</sup></a>. However, often Indigenous Peoples seem to not want to collaborate or compromise with the powers of industry and the state that is destroying the way of life. Support for Indigenous People, within the context of climate change, means providing full and uncompromising backing for Indigenous rights, including to land, self-determination and cultural heritage. It requires reconceptualizing land, not as a commodity or the site of production and extraction, but rather as the basis for community existence. Indigenous lives have been undervalued for centuries. An opportunist and belated acknowledgment of their value for “successful adaptation to climate change” is at best hypocritical if not followed by a convincing rejection of the market structures that are causing their demise.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn166"><p><sup>166</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="ipccwg2">H.-O.

<p>Additional inspiring cases of struggle against sovereignty, and tyranny are readily available and diverse, highlighting the need of adapting global struggles —such as neoliberalism, racism, imperialism and colonialism— to local realities. Lessons can be drawn, among others, from the histories of the Black Panther Party in the USA, the Italian resistance movement, the South African Communist Party, the Algerian National Liberation front and the African independence party of Burkina Faso.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The study of history of past resistances is invaluable not only to draw strength and inspiration for the fight ahead, but also to realize that inevitability of upcoming global crisis, given the inherent contradiction within capitalism. The production and re-production of capital requires continuous expansion and exploitation, and it is indifferent to human needs and ecological constrains. Within the paradigm of capital maximization exists tensions which have regularly —and inevitably will in the future— create periods of rupture. There is undoubtedly not going to be a shortage of global crisis in the future, that is certain. It is necessary however to acknowledge that often from the aftermath of economic crisis, through the general confusion and instability, the strong arm of the Leviathan has appeared to reinforce systems of domination and oppression. Examples of this type dynamics can be found by looking at the Greek <em>sovereign</em> debt crisis of late 2009<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168" role="doc-noteref"><sup>168</sup></a> which resulted in structural adjustment programs and punishing austerity in exchange for loans from the IMF and the European Stability Mechanism. Another clear instance is the series of structural adjustment policies in dozens of African countries including Uganda, Angola, Zimbabwe and Zambia in the 1980s pushed by IMF and World Bank following the early 1980 recession<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169" role="doc-noteref"><sup>169</sup></a>. The result was incalculable human suffering, massive increase in poverty and the reinforcing of cycles of dependency.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn168"><p><sup>168</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="to_our_friends">comité invisible (<a href="#ref-to_our_friends" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;12</p></li><li id="fn169"><p><sup>169</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="the_divide">Hickel (<a href="#ref-the_divide" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;150</p></li></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Nevertheless crisis can present also opportunities to radically reevaluate where value and power lays. The covid pandemic made clear who is an essential worker and who is not. The workers who are essentials —and therefore most valuable to society— are not the CEO, the financier or the tech executive, but rather the grocery store clerks, the sanitation worker and the nurse. Similarly, the housing crisis of 2007-2008 illustrated how something so crucial to human survival, such as shelter, is valued in the market. When the housing market froze houses could not be sold. Their sale value was 0 because there was no market for it<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170" role="doc-noteref"><sup>170</sup></a>. A clear example of how price and value are radically different concepts, whose relationship must be reconsidered and challenged.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn170"><p><sup>170</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="the_value">D. Harvey (<a href="#ref-the_value" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span></p></li></div></div>
<p>The challenge ahead is therefore to reach a critical mass of informed, conscious people, ready and organized to make sure that the next crisis is exploited for radical social change and not for further repression.</p>
